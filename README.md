# swf-sns-python-example
Sample implementation of a simple AWS SWF SNS app using boto3 and Python that mirrors the AWS Ruby based tutorial.

The "official" Ruby version of this tutorial is available from AWS Documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-sns-tutorial.html

You can read the offical tutorial to get a more detailed breakdown of the steps, with Ruby code. This implementation mirrors the tutorial, except the code is in Python.
